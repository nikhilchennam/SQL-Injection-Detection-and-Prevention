# SQL Injection Prevention System Project in PHP using BOOTSTRAP
"SQL Injection Attack" is widely used by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems. A software system is developed to prevent unauthorized access to the system using SQL injection attacks. It is done by adding unique value and a signature-based authentication technique to verify authenticity. SQL injection is a major security issue these days that allows an attacker to gain access to a web system or application exploiting certain vulnerabilities. Our software project puts forth a method to analyze and detect the malicious code to find out and prevent the attack.

Technologies used:
Front End : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Ajax
Back End: PHP and MySQL database
